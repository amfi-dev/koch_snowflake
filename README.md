# Koch Snowflake Python
The Koch snowflake (also known as the Koch curve, Koch star, or Koch island[1][2]) is a fractal curve and one of the earliest fractals to have been described. It is based on the Koch curve, which appeared in a 1904 paper titled "On a Continuous Curve Without Tangents, Constructible from Elementary Geometry"[3] by the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch.
